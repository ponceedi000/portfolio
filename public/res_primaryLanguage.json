      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Eddie Ponce, and I am a Software Developer from Vancouver, WA. I am also a USMC Veteran who served five years on Active-Duty orders as a Ground Intelligence Analyst/Platoon Sergeant and received multiple awards and certifications during my time in service. I chose to get into Software Development because of the problem solving/critical-thinking aspect of the job and I like to think of myself as a logical thinker. I write code just about everyday and enjoy learning about new technology on my off time! Some professional skills I acquire are leadership, problem-solving, teamwork, commercial awareness, perseverance, and motivation. I'm seeking to make a positive impact in my next workspace and to continuously challenge my limits as a soon-to-be Software Developer.",
