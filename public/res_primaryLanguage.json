      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Eddie Ponce, and I am a Full Stack Software Developer based out of Vancouver, WA. I am also a USMC Veteran who served five years on Active-Duty orders as a Ground Intelligence Analyst and later became a Regimental Intelligence Chief. During my honorable service I received multiple awards and certifications in both CONUS and O-CONUS operations. I chose to get into Software Development because of the problem solving/critical-thinking aspect of the job, similar to my past duties as an Analyst. I write code just about every day and enjoy learning about newly released technology on my spare time! Though I am happiest with front-end development, I've recently grown a huge interest in back-end development too! My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact in my next workspace and to continuously challenge my limits as a Software Developer.",
